# Class Comments

Welcome! This site accompanies the GitHub repository for our class exercise. You will practice creating a Pull Request by adding your entry to the shared comments page.

- ðŸ‘‰ **Instructions for students:** see the repository's [Instruction.md](https://github.com/RJBT04/class-comments-project/blob/main/Instruction.md)
- ðŸ’¬ **Comment board:** [comments.md](/class-comments-project/comments)
- ðŸ“¦ **Repository:** https://github.com/RJBT04/class-comments-project

## How it works
1. Fork the repository and create a branch.
2. Append your entry to the bottom of [comments.md](/class-comments-project/comments).
3. Open a Pull Request back to the main repository.

Have fun and be respectful.
